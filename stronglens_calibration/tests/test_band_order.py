Band Order Assertion Test.

LLM1 Prompt 3 Q3.1: "Add a one-time assertion test that reads a known cutout
and verifies band identity via metadata or simple color sanity checks."

This test verifies that g=channel 0, r=channel 1, z=channel 2 is consistent
between:
  1. Cutout generation (g,r,z order in HWC format)
  2. Training data loader (transpose to CHW preserves order)
  3. Injection engine (assumes channel 0=g, 1=r, 2=z)

Color sanity: for typical galaxies and sky, g-band flux < r-band flux < z-band
flux (red galaxies dominate at faint magnitudes in nanomaggies). If bands were
swapped (e.g., g<->z), we'd see the opposite pattern.

Usage:
    cd stronglens_calibration
    export PYTHONPATH=.
    python -m pytest tests/test_band_order.py -v
