  "interpretation": "FAIL: Model still predicts lens with p=0.62 when arcs are removed. For low-SNR arcs (SNR<2), drop is only 0.22, meaning the model barely uses the arc. For high-SNR (SNR>20), drop is 0.69 - model does use arcs when visible. Overall, the model heavily relies on core shortcuts, especially for faint arcs."
